    <h2>Name's background</h2>
    <p>The singer Fairouz was called Fayrouz because Halim Al-Rumi, the head of Lebanese Radio, suggested she adopt the stage name. Al-Rumi gave her the name "Fairuz," which means "turquoise" or "precious stone" in Arabic, because her voice reminded him of the precious stone. She was born Nuhad al-Haddad and initially thought the suggestion was a joke, but she later took his advice. </p>
